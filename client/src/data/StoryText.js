  intro: "You push open the rusted door and step forward, taking in your surroundings. Peeling paint, severed cables and dust-covered machine parts litter the floor. A single shaft of light seeps in from a clouded skylight in the high ceiling, illuminating a single workbench in the middle of the room. As you approach the workbench, you're startled to find it clean, with a pristine toolkit and a small stack of raw materials nearby. In the time you've been exploring this abandoned factory—Has it been hours? Days? Months?—this is the first place you've found clean of the decay and neglect that coats everything else.\n\nYou feel a compulsion to use the workbench, out of curiosity or something else... Maybe you should try restoring some small part of this factory; bring a bit of life back to the shell of this building.\n\nYou raise your hammer...",

  mainChamber: "\n\nThe factory floor is too cluttered; you can't concentrate on your work with your surroundings this messy! You spend some time clearing the central chamber, methodically restoring each part of it until you could almost forget it was ever so neglected.",
  
  environmentPurification: "\n\nAs you work harder, and the restored machines whirr faster and faster, the Factory's main chamber is filling back up with failed prototypes, piles of scrap, and noxious smoke. You cannot allow your work to be slowed, so you install a system of exhausts, incinerators and conveyors to dispose of waste. The Factory's core is now pure again. You turn back to your workstation...",
  
  inputLines: "\n\nHow can your work ever be finished if you keep having to venture out of the Factory's core to gather raw materials? You cannot stop now. You construct input lines to bring the resources you need directly into the central chamber from the Factory's stores and mines. You have brought life back to the Factory, now the Factory will provide for you. Your work will never stop again.",

  buildHeart: "\n\nThe grinding and screeching of the Factory is beautiful to hear. But now the most important stage of your work is upon you—the Heart of the Factory is still incomplete. You have no idea how long you work, etching the finest details on every millimetre of the Heart. It does not matter. Only the Factory matters. Finally, you step back, and the Heart whirrs to life.",

  winGame: "Your work can never end. For as long as you live, you can continue your work and keep the Factory alive. But your body is already failing, and without a mind to maintain it, the Factory will die again. You cannot preserve your body forever. But you can give your mind to the Factory. You move towards the Heart, and it opens wide to accept you—the Factory already knows what it needs from you. You step inside, and the Heart closes. Your consciousness shatters to each corner of the Factory, and the material that was your body is flushed to a conveyor, to be categorised and reused. The Factory grows..."
